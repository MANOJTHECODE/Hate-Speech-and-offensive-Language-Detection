# Hate-Speech-and-offensive-Language-Detection

This project focuses on classifying hate speech using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build models that can accurately predict hate speech based on the text of the tweets.

## Introduction
The project utilizes natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to preprocess the text data, extract features, and train classification models. Various models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, are implemented to classify hate speech.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.

## Usage
1. Prepare the labeled dataset (CSV format) and update the dataset path in the code.
2. Run the code to train and evaluate the models.

## Results
The models' performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, and their accuracy scores are measured for predicting hate speech. The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for hate speech classification.
